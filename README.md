# SQL-Python
Test that I did for the selection process in a company. 
In this test the following tests should be performed: 

- Write a MySQL query to calculate the average square meter price of properties with an increased price in 2016 that have a square meter area > 200 (built up or used area).   
- Write a MySQL query to: - Count the number of properties that had an increased price in 2016 and the average raise in percentage of price/sqm of those properties; 
- Count the number of properties that had a decreased price in 2016 and the average decrease in percentage of price/sqm of those properties;  
The output of the query should be: Number of properties with increased price in 2016; Average percentage of increased price/sqm of those properties; Number of properties with decreased price in 2016; Average percentage of decreased price/sqm of those properties;  - Using Python: predict an average price for properties with a built area between 200 and 300 sq.m. and sea views** in January, February, March, April and May 2018. Please describe the process and include the code.  4. Using Python: with a scatter plot, visualise undervalued outliers with a sea view**.
